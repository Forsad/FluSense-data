# FluSense-data

[AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/) data (originally released by Google) labeled for the FluSense project (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381014).

The TextGrid labels files are under flusense_data folder. To get the audio use the following link: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c-qkb_ljD6xXqU4AGm4jEf8-lygRjLtS?usp=sharing)

# Labels
